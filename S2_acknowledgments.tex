\Acknowledgments{The least we can do for those that help us achieve goals is recognizing the people that help us and lift us up along the way that ended up with more bumps than anticipated. Thank you to my wife's and my baby boy for their encouragement. I am grateful for the guidance and help with research from Dr. Johnson and Logen Yale Bergerud who joined on every data collection assisting in all ways that were needed when more hands were best. I appreciate the opportunity provided by Lonnie Jarvis, the creator of this project and for the experience to work with him on his product optimization for Mission Silencers. Thanks as well to any others that made this research possible.}
