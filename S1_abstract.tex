\Abstract{A suppressor is a device that screws onto the end of a firearm's muzzle. The purpose of suppressors is to reduce the sound volume at the shooter's ear. Mission Silencers have innovative suppressor technology that goes beyond sound pressure level values and optimization. This thesis describes the work of looking into each variable that a suppressor impacts. The variables that were measured for suppressor optimization are bolt velocity, blow-back, noise spectral density and, as always, sound pressure level. Suppression of firearms introduces more blow-back and increases bolt velocity, which are each a negative effect for the firearm and its operator. The goal was negation of excessive bolt velocity and blow-back that would otherwise break the firearm or disrupt the effectiveness of the firearm operator; reaching the point of what an unsuppressed semiautomatic AR15 style rifle would have. In this study, the goal was to minimize these undesired effects while reducing the sound pressure level at the operators location to below 140 decibels. Also, a comparison is made between the spectral profile of a suppressed shot and an unsuppressed shot because sound is more or less painful because of the frequencies present in the sound and not solely the decibel level. Existing industry standards are used while implementing proposed new standards for otherwise untested variables when using a suppressive device on an AR15 style rifle.}
